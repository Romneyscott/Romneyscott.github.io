    <h2> Your Five Buisness Introduction Rules</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Stand Up:</strong>When you are seated and someone approaches you to say hello with a handshake, stand up, whether you are a man or a woman. By doing so, you show the person you are greeting that  they are worth your full attention</li>
    <li><strong>Make Eye Contact:</strong>By looking someone directly in the eye, you acomplish three things</li></ol>
<al>
    <li> You will project an image of self-confidence and a healthy self-esteem</li>
    <li> You will be perceived as a good listener</li>
    <li> You will probably recieve the same courtesy when you speak</li>
    
    
    
    </al>
    <ol start="3">
        <li><strong>Smile:</strong>It sends others a message of acceptance</li>
        <li><strong>Say Your Name:</strong>If you are meeting some one for the first time you should introduce yourself using youf first and last name</li>
        <li><strong>Shake Hands:</strong>Generally speaking, a handshake should last only as long as it takes to greet the person. It should be firm enough to display your sense of confidence without being a bonecrusher</li>
    </ol>
