    <article> This section will have two articles grouped together. The section containers are used to group other elements together, usually for positioning purposes so we will use them more in the later lessons. Elements may also be grouped together in a section to so that the area of the page grouped by the section can be formatted with the same style, or background color such as this example</article>
